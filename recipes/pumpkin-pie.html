            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>Pastry for the Single-Crust Pie:</h3>

                <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup shortening</li>
                <li>3 ½ tablespoons cold water</li>

                <h3>Filling:</h3>

                <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin, or about 1 1/2 pounds skin-on, raw pumpkin; <br>
                    <aside>
                        Shortcut: You can substitute with canned pumpkin.
                        Before you buy, you should check the label to make sure of what's in the can;
                        if it's labeled "pumpkin pie filling" it's already spiced.
                        If you plan to sweeten yourself with the ingredients below, go for unflavored canned pumpkin.
                    </aside>
                </li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare Mashed Pumpkin</strong><br>
                    Unless you're using canned pumpkin, you'll first need to prepare the mashed pumpkin. <br>
                    Start with 1 1/2 pounds of skin-on, raw pumpkin to yield 2 cups of mashed:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Halve pumpkin and scoop out seeds and stringy portions. You can save the seeds for a roasted, crunchy snack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut the pumpkin into chunks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a saucepan over medium heat, cover the pumpkin chunks with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until tender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain, cool and remove the peel. Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat Oven</strong><br>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Pie Crust</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar, and salt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li><strong>Form Pie Crust</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. <br>
                        (You can use any dough scraps to make decorative shapes using small leaf-shaped cookie cutters and place them on top of the pie filling.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. <br>
                        Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan. <br>
                        Form a crust by folding the overhanging edges under and crimp as desired.
                    </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the filling into your prepared crust.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li><strong>Bake Pie</strong><br>
                    Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean. <br>

            <p><strong>How to Tell When Pumpkin Pie Is Done</strong><br>
            Pumpkin pie can be a little tricky because you want the custard filling to be cooked but you don't want it to be overcooked — that's what causes pumpkin pie filling to separate, or "crack." <br>
            And while that's not the end of the earth, it's not pretty. So, how can you tell when pumpkin pie is done? Here are some ways to tell:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pie filling temperature is about 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) when measured near the center of the pie.</li>
                    <li>A table knife inserted near the center of the pie comes out cleanly, with no liquid pie filling sticking to it.</li>
                    <li>The pie filling is very slightly wobbly towards the center of the pie when you give it a jiggle. The pie filling will continue to cook and set up even after you remove it from the oven, due to its residual heat.</li>
                </ul>
